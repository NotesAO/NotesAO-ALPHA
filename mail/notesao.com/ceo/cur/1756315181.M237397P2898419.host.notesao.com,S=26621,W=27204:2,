Hi Gabriel,

This is exactly the kind of workflow where Twilio really shines=E2=80=94you=
'll be
able to go from manually uploading spreadsheets to sending automated daily
reminders straight from your own system, no more copy-paste or CSV
headaches.

Let=E2=80=99s break this down into the two things you asked about: how the =
API
works (with practical guides), and what your real-world monthly costs would
look like for your volumes.
------------------------------
1. How the Twilio SMS API Works (with Guides)

*Big picture:* You=E2=80=99ll write a quick script (any language) or add lo=
gic to
your app that calls Twilio=E2=80=99s API each day to send out your reminder=
s. No
need for spreadsheets or manual uploads; your schedule, recipients, and
messages can all be managed right from your existing database.

*Here=E2=80=99s what the typical setup looks like:*

   1. *Upgrade your Twilio account*
      - The trial is great to test, but you=E2=80=99ll need to upgrade to g=
o live
      and send to real (unverified) numbers.
   2. *Buy a US phone number in the Twilio Console*
      - Most folks grab a local (10-digit) number or a toll-free; it just
      takes a few clicks.
   3. *Register for A2P 10DLC (for local numbers) or verify your Toll-Free
   (if you go that route)*
      - This is required for all US SMS business messaging to keep
      deliverability high. Registration is handled right from the
Console with a
      step-by-step flow. See *Nonprofit & Government A2P 10DLC Guide
      <https://help.twilio.com/articles/4405850570267>* for details (even
      if you=E2=80=99re not a nonprofit, it=E2=80=99s a great walkthrough).
   4. *Set up a Messaging Service*
      - This acts as your sending =E2=80=9Chub=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94you assign =
your number(s), and it
      handles compliance, opt-out keywords, automation, and scaling.
   5. *Write your script or app logic*
      - For a daily group blast, just loop over your recipients and call
      the API for each. You can use concurrency or batching if you=E2=80=99=
re
sending all
      700 at once.

*Here are some concrete getting-started links:*

   - SMS API Developer Quickstart (choose your language!)
   <https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/quickstart>
   - How to Send SMS (step-by-step)
   <https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/tutorials/how-to-send-sms-message=
s>
   - SMS Foundations: Key concepts, compliance, and onboarding
   <https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/onboarding/sms-foundations>
   - Programmable Messaging product docs
   <https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging>
   - US A2P 10DLC Registration: Full Nonprofit/Government Guide (with
   pricing table) <https://help.twilio.com/articles/4405850570267>
   - How to check your A2P registration status or number configuration
   <https://help.twilio.com/articles/4418081745179>

*To give you a sense of code simplicity:*
Here=E2=80=99s what sending a message looks like in Python (swap for your f=
avorite
language):

from twilio.rest import Client
client =3D Client("ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", "your_auth_token")

numbers =3D ["+15551112222", "+15553334444", ...]  # list your recipients

for number in numbers:
    client.messages.create(
        body=3D"Your daily reminder text here",
        from_=3D"+12345678901",  # Your Twilio number
        to=3Dnumber
    )

You=E2=80=99d just run this on a daily schedule (cron job, Windows Task Sch=
eduler,
etc).
------------------------------
2. Pricing Estimate for Your Use Case

You=E2=80=99re sending about *7,000 SMS/month to 700 contacts*, all in the =
US.

Here=E2=80=99s what to expect (bolded for easy skimming):
Cost Element *Price* Notes / Links
Outbound SMS (Twilio fee) *$0.0083 / message* Twilio US SMS Pricing
<https://www.twilio.com/en-us/sms/pricing/us>
Carrier Pass-Thru Fees *$0.003 =E2=80=93 $0.005 / message* Varies by carrie=
r, see fee
table <https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260803965530>
Phone number lease *$1.15/mo (local) or $2.15 (toll-free)* Charged monthly;
billed per number
A2P 10DLC registration fees *$4.50 (one-time brand reg) + $15 campaign
vetting (one-time) + $10/mo campaign fee* Nonprofit "Charity" use case:
$3/mo campaign fee; see A2P pricing table
<https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260803965530>
Inbound SMS (if recipients reply) *$0.0083/message + carrier fee* Only if
you want replies; see same pricing page
<https://www.twilio.com/en-us/sms/pricing/us>

*Estimated monthly cost for 7,000 messages:*

   - Outbound: 7,000 =C3=97 (~$0.0113) =E2=89=88 *$79.10* (using typical bl=
ended fee for
   AT&T/T-Mobile)
   - Phone number: *$1.15*
   - A2P campaign fee: *$10* (or $3 for nonprofits)
   - *Total ballpark:* about *$90=E2=80=93$93/month* (lower for charities; =
plus a
   one-time setup fee ~$19.50)

*Heads up:*

   - *A2P registration (brand/campaign) approval can take 1=E2=80=937 busin=
ess
   days.* Start this early.
   - Throughput (messages-per-second) is determined by your "trust score"
   and campaign type. For your use case, this will easily cover scheduled
   daily sends, but if you plan to hit all 700 at the exact same second, le=
t
   me know for more on batching/burst guidance.

*Everything above is pay-as-you-go. There=E2=80=99s no annual contract or m=
inimum
monthly, and all pricing is fully transparent here
<https://www.twilio.com/en-us/sms/pricing/us>.*
------------------------------
Getting It Live: Checklist

   1. *Upgrade your Twilio account* (add billing info)
   2. *Buy your number* (local or toll-free) in the Console
   3. *Kick off A2P 10DLC registration* (follow this guide
   <https://help.twilio.com/articles/4405850570267>)
   4. *Create a Messaging Service* (assign your number to it)
   5. *Send a test SMS via API* (start with quickstart code
   <https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/quickstart>)
   6. *Build out your daily scheduler* (cron job or server script)

------------------------------

*A few questions to help tailor your setup:*

   - Will all 700 recipients be US mobile numbers, or do you text folks
   internationally?
   - Do you want users to reply to your reminders (two-way), or just
   receive one-way notifications?
   - Preference for a local (10-digit) vs. toll-free number as your sender?
   - Do you plan to blast all 700 at once or stagger sends over the day?
   - Any specific programming language or framework you=E2=80=99d like samp=
le code
   in?

Let me know your answers, and I=E2=80=99ll get you direct links for your la=
nguage
and next steps!

If you have a sample use case or want a guide for handling opt-outs,
compliance, or two-way messaging, let me know=E2=80=94there are lots of
plug-and-play docs for each situation.

Ready when you are=E2=80=94excited to help you go from =E2=80=9Cspreadsheet=
 hell=E2=80=9D to a
completely automated reminder flow!
