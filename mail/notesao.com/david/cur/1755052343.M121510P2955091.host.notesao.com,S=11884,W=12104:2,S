Hello,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is David House. I am with
Notes AO.

Notes AO is a web application that generates one
thousand individualuzed unique progress notes in less than 15 minutes that
are TDCJ-CJAD compliant- from entrance notifications to completion notes &
certificates. It tracks attendance, performs Instant MAR, and much more,
all on a HIPAA compliant server with 4 administrator and 15 user /
facilitator accounts.

I would love to set up a quick demo with you and your administration to
show you just how this program works. I believe you will be blown away by
how it eliminates administrative burden, gives you back time for yourself
and your family, and increases referrals from sources happy to have
documentation on their desk before they need it.

Please give me a call to talk more about it. I am available anytime. Thank
you so much,

David House
