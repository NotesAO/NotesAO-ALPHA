Good afternoon Allison,
I hope you are doing well. I just wanted to touch base. Wanted to see 
what your supervisor had to say. Also wanted to let you know that we do 
a lunch and learn every Wednesday at 12pm. It is for anyone interested 
and may have questions. We can go over any part of the program as well. 
Look forward to hearing back from you. Have a great rest of your week.
