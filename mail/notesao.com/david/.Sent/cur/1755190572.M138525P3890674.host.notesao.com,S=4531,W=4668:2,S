Initial email sent for safer path. I will be more than happy to send 
that to them once we have received payment and questionnaire has been 
answered and sent back.  I don't want to over whelm them that much info 
for first onboarding email. That could probably be intimidating. I have 
no idea why they used the vanericmartin email. I have only communicated 
with mine. But yes I believe we do not need to be using that email.
