Corre,
We are so excited to start the onboarding process. Attached to this 
email is Gabriel. He will be imputing everything into NotesAO. You will 
be receiving emails from both of us. He uses the admin@notesao.com. 
During this process if you have any questions please do not hesitate to 
ask. The onboarding process will go as fast as you get information to 
us.

Next Steps:
1. Onboarding payment $500 will be sent to you. There is a 3% CC fee. 
Payment will show up as $515
2. Onboarding paperwork will be sent once payment has been made and 
questionnaire has been filled out.  There will be clear instructions on 
what to do. (any questions during this process please do not hesitate to 
ask)
3. Any logos you like for us to use please send over.
4. Any PDFs you like to use (ie. homework for client portal) please send 
to us.
