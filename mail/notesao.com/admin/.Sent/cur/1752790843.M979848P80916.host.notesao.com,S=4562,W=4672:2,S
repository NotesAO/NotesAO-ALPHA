Good evening Team The Best Option (Mercy & Helen),

Thank you for sending the large batch of 100+ documents. Here is a clear 
snapshot of where we stand and what we still need to go live.

WHAT WE’VE ALREADY COMPLETED

* Created your “Best Option” clinic profile and empty database in 
NotesAO.
* Entered all admin, facilitator, and billing user accounts.
* Uploaded your logo and applied it across the portal and all automated 
forms.
* Catalogued and tagged roughly two‑thirds of the 100 + PDFs you 
provided.
* Activated all automation scripts in test mode so we can run trial 
reports as soon as the missing templates arrive.

TEMPLATES STILL NEEDED
BIPP (male & female)

* Unexcused‑Absence Notification letter
* Monthly BIPP Progress‑Report letter (the narrative courts usually 
require)
* Completion Progress‑Report (one‑page narrative that accompanies the 
certificate)
* BIPP Behavior Contract (the pledge participants sign in week 1)

Anger Control

* Unexcused‑Absence Notification letter
* Monthly Progress‑Report letter (if your courts or referral sources 
require it)
* Completion Progress‑Report (only if it differs from the certificate 
already provided)

Cross‑program
Stage‑of‑Change Excel note template: because you supplied full 
curricula, we are already drafting this spreadsheet for you—no action 
required unless you wish to review the wording.

We only need one clean DOCX or ODT example of each item. Merge‑fields 
are not necessary; we will insert them on our side.

STATUS OF EVERY MAIN NOTESAO PAGE
Clients – Intake screens are live. We can bulk‑import a CSV later if you 
have existing clients, or staff can enter them one by one.
Report Generator – Fully wired but cannot produce final PDFs until the 
five templates above are in place.
Check‑In – Functional now. If your standard weekly fee differs from the 
$25 default or you allow clients to pay down old balances, just let us 
know and we will set that up.
Sessions – All 26 BIPP sessions and the 8‑session Anger Control block 
are loaded. Send any changes and we will update them.
Case Managers / Officers – Feature is ready; we simply need names and 
email addresses so progress reports reach the right people.
Curriculum – Complete for all three programs.
Victims – Entrance, exit, and completion victim letters are in place. If 
you want automatic copies sent to any advocate emails, provide those 
addresses.
Groups – Page loads, but we still need the final schedule: day, start 
time, location or Zoom link, assigned facilitator, and any attendance 
cap.

HOW TO SEND THE FILES
Just reply to this email and attach the documents—there are no file‑size 
limits on our end. If you prefer a secure upload link instead, let us 
know and we will provide one.

LUNCH‑AND‑LEARN
We have a full one‑hour Zoom session reserved for Wednesday, July 23 at 
12:00 PM Central. If that slot is not convenient, the alternate time is 
Friday, July 25 at 12:00 PM Central. Please confirm which works best and 
we will send the calendar invite.

TIMELINE ONCE WE RECEIVE THE TEMPLATES
Day 0 – You send the missing documents
Days 1‑3 – We import them, run dummy‑client tests, and confirm every 
letter and report merges correctly
Days 4‑5 – Live smoke test with you on a short Zoom call
Day 7 – Portal opens to real clients and nightly automations switch to 
production mode

We are confident we can have everything fully operational within one 
week of receiving the final templates.

If anything is unclear or you need help producing the remaining 
documents, feel free to email or call me at +1 (214) 502‑4322.

Warm regards,

Gabriel Thomas
