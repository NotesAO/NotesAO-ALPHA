Hey David,

Can you reach out to Helen or Mercy with The Best Option and just have a 
sit-down Zoom meeting with them seeing what exactly they are waiting for 
in the system?

They have over 80 clients in the system ready to go with attendance 
tracking. I do not have time to meet with them and code (currently 
juggling 6 different projects in the system).

I know their documents aren't ready yet, but besides that most aspects 
of the system are up and running for them already.

When meeting with them use these credentials to log into their site:

username: admin

password: admin

clinic: tbo
