Dear Dr. Lankford and Team,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the 
onboarding process for Lankford Avenue LLC in the NotesAO system, as 
well as outline the next steps needed to complete setup.

Progress to Date
We have completed all possible setup work with the information currently 
available, including:

	*

Adding all programs listed in your onboarding form to your account.
	*

Implementing the Duluth Model curriculum for BIPP (male).
	*

Creating user accounts for all administrators and facilitators you 
provided.

Next Steps - Items Needed from Your Team
To complete your onboarding and ensure the system is ready for live use, 
we will need the following:

	*

Curriculum Material for All Programs

	*

Please provide the full curriculum outlines, lesson plans, or 
participant materials for each program you offer (including non-BIPP 
programs such as Marijuana Education, Anger Management, Thinking for a 
Change, etc.).

	*

Template Report Documents

	*

Any templates you use for reports (e.g., court reports, progress 
reports, completion certificates, victim letters including Entrance, 
Completion, and Exit) so we can configure them within the system. 	* 
Preferably in .docx or .pdf format.

	*

Client Demographic and Attendance Data

	*

Begin filling in the provided example CSV file with:

	*

Client demographic details for all current and past clients in any 
program.
	*

Attendance records for each client. 	* NOTE: when filling out "IMPORT 
CSV wPayments" be sure to enter each attendance date under each P1 
through P35 field followed by the payment receive for that group per 
client on P1_payment through P35_payment.

	*

Victim Information

	*

Any victim contact details and notification processes you currently use.

	*

Intake Processes

	*

A completed example of your intake packet so we can replicate your 
intake forms and workflows in NotesAO.

	*

Payment Amounts and Balances

	*

Current program fees, payment schedules, and any outstanding balances 
for existing clients.

	*

Officer / Case Manager Information

	*

Names and contact details for all associated officers, probation/parole 
staff, CPS workers, attorneys, or other referring parties. 	* At 
minimum: name, location, & email address or fax number

	*

Group Schedules & Links

	*

Days/times for each program's groups throughout the week.
	*

Virtual meeting links for each group session.

Once these items are received, we can complete the build-out of your 
account and move into final testing and training.

If you have any questions about the requested items or need assistance 
compiling them, please let me know. We're excited to get Lankford Avenue 
fully operational on NotesAO and ensure your team can begin using all 
available tools as quickly as possible.

Best regards,

Gabriel
NotesAO | Senior Developer
