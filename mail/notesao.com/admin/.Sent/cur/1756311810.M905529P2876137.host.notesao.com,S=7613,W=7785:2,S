Hi Isa,

Yes, we are interested in having access to the API to build out an 
automated daily group text reminder from our server.

I would love any and all guides or how to material you can provide. I 
created a trial account and look around the dashboard but that's about 
it for now.

We are currently using the service "Text-em-all" for our text reminders 
and it works well, but the biggest constraint is that they do not offer 
an integratable API to automate their process. We have to keep 
spreadsheets with numbers and columns for text that we load into their 
site manually and send. Since our system stores all this data its just a 
lot of extra work. Also, we are paying about $200 to send unlimited 
messages to about 700 unique numbers. We actually send about 7000 
messages monthly.

So my main question is 1. how exactly does your API work and what are 
some of its requirements to run and 2. what type of pricing would we be 
looking at monthly for all this?

Best,

Gabriel
