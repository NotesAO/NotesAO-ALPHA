Hello,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is David House. I am with Notes A=
O. Notes AO is a web application that can generate up to a thousand notes i=
n less than 15 minutes that are TDCJ-CJAD compliant. It also has the capabi=
lity to track attendance and Instant MAR and many more features.  I would l=
ove to set up a demo with you and your administration and show you just how=
 this program works. I believe you will be blown away, and it will relieve =
the administrative burden that you may be facing now. Please give me a call=
 to talk more about it. I am available anytime. Thank you so much
