Looking for stand alone software for SUD clients in the legal system and also with DFPS. I want to keep my mental health records in my Simple Practice and to keep contracted services for DFPS and Probation in another. Schedule for LCDC and LCDC Intern and possibly adding more LCDC subcontractors to my group. I am working toward being able to provide BIPP services in the future.
I remember speaking with you briefly at the conference in Corpus Christi. I would like to know what the cost would be for what I am looking for and also demonstration or a practice demo I can try.
