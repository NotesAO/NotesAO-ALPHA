Allison,
Thank you for your email. Do you have time for a phone call? We can set 
up a time over the phone. Call me anytime 214-502-4322

If phone call does not work, my schedule is pretty open. Only time I am 
not available is this Thursday afternoon. Please look at your calendar 
and let me know of a date and I can put it on calendar. Thank you

David House
