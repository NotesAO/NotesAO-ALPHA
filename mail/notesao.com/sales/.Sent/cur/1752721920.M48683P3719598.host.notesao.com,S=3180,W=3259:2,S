Did we take care of this? Is she updated on where we are in the process? 
Just making sure this email wasn't overlooked. Thanks guys. I would 
answer email, but I do not know of where we are in the onboarding 
process, and I do not know about the lunch and learns.

  Good morning,

  Helen mentioned back on July 8th we would have a Lunch and Learn. I
believe that it was rescheduled for this week. Also just wanting to find
out where we are in this process, what else is required, when we are
thinking of a start date?

  Any information would be greatly appreciated ðŸ™‚

  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call the office at
210.265.1133.
