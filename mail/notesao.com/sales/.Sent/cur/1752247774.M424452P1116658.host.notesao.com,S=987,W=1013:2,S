Hello,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is David House. I am with 
Notes AO. Notes AO is a web application that can generate up to a 
thousand notes in less than 15 minutes that are TDCJ-CJAD compliant. It 
also has the capability to track attendance and Instant MAR and much 
more features.  I would love to set up a demo with you and your 
administration and show you just how this program works. I believe you 
will be blown away, and it will relieve the administrative burden that 
you may be facing now. Please give me a call to talk more about it. I am 
available anytime. Thank you so much

David House
