Heather,
Good morning. It was wonderful talking with you a couple days ago. I 
would like to see if you would like to jump on a call at your 
convenience with Van and I. We would like to discuss your thoughts on 
what it is you would like to see on the program and just have a 
conversation to help us get it right. Look forward to hearing from you.
