Hi Van,

I hope your week is going well.

Iâ€™m testing my new NotesAO email address to make sure messages are 
getting through to your inbox. When you have a moment, could you please 
let me know if this arrived in your primary inbox or spam folder? That 
will help us fine-tune our sending setup.

Thanks for your help, and I look forward to catching up soon.

Best regards,
David House
