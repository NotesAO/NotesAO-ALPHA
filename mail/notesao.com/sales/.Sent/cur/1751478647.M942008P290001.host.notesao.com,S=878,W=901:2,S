Allison,
I hope you are doing well. I hope you have had some time to digest the 
information that we went over in our meeting. It was a lot of 
information but the program is already helping so many entities like 
yours already. I wanted to see if we could have a quick chat and get 
your thoughts on it. Please let me know of a good time or please just 
reach out to me whenever you have time. my number is 214-502-4322. I 
look forward to speaking with you about NotesAO. Thank you so much again 
and Happy 4th!!

David House
