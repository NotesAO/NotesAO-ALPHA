Anissa,

It was wonderful meeting you at the TCFV conference. Wanted to reach out 
to set up a time to go over Notes AO one on one without any 
interruptions. You can invite anyone to the call you would like. Please 
let me know when the best time for you would be. I look forward to 
speaking to you. Have a great day.
