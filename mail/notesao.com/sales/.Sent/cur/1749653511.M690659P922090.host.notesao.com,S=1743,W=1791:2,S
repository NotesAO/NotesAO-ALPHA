Helen,
We are so excited to start the onboarding process. Attached to this 
email is Gabriel. He will be imputing everything into NotesAO. You will 
be receiving emails from both of us. He uses the admin@notesao.com. 
During this process if you have any questions please do not hesitate to 
ask. The onboarding process will go as fast as you get information to 
us.

Next Steps:
1. Onboarding payment $500 will be sent to you.
2. Please send over emails of all users. Please label the emails admin 
or facilitators.
3. Onboarding paperwork will be sent once payment has been made and 
emails have been sent to us. There will be clear instructions on what to 
do. (any questions during this process please do not hesitate to ask)
4. Any logos you like for us to use please send over.
5. Any PDFs you like to use (ie. homework for client portal) please send 
to us.

Again, we are so excited to get The Best Option up and running using 
NotesAO. We look forward to working with all of you and making this as 
seamless as possible.
