This is a reminder of your Tarrant County Parole Mandated Batterers Intervention & Prevention Program (BIPP) happening tonight at 7:30PM sharp. Your attendance is crucial as both Officer Alba Ramirez and TDCJ expect you to be there. We open the doors at 7:00PM. Please arrive 20 minutes early to register in. 

Remember, failure to attend may result in serious consequences, including incarceration. We do not want that for you. So, please make sure to be on time and ready to participate fully in the group.

In case you encounter any technical difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out to Van at 817-501-5102 for assistance.



On a positive note, we believe that you have the strength and ability to make positive changes in your life.
