<p><em>Last Updated: [</em><em>August 29</em><em>, 2025]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction and Acceptance of Terms</strong>
This End User Agreement (“Agreement” or “EUA”) is a legal contract between you (the authorized clinic or user, including healthcare workers, administrators, and LPC-certified group facilitators) and <em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em>, a service provided by Free for Life Group PC (based in Fort Worth, Texas). <em>NotesAO </em>is a report generator and functional clinic database primarily used for group-based attendance tracking in clinical and counseling settings. By accessing or using the <em>NotesAO </em>service (“Service” or “Platform”), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this EUA. If you do not agree with these terms, you must not use the Service.<strong>

<p>• <strong>Authorized Users and Account Creation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Account Provisioning:</strong> Accounts on <em>NotesAO </em>are created and managed exclusively by <em>NotesAO </em>staff. There is no public self-registration. Each client clinic or organization will be provided with a limited number of user accounts: typically, <strong>two</strong><strong> administrative accounts</strong> (for clinic administrators) and <strong>fifteen</strong><strong> member accounts</strong> (for facilitators or staff). If additional accounts are required, you must request them from <em>NotesAO</em><em>,</em> and such accounts will only be created at <em>NotesAO</em>’s discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> The Service is intended for use by clinics and authorized personnel (such as licensed healthcare providers, counselors, and administrative staff). You may use <em>NotesAO </em>only if you are an authorized user under an active clinic subscription. Each user must have unique login credentials and must be officially associated with the subscribing clinic. Users must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your area) and professionally trained or qualified for handling sensitive clinical data.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Credentials:</strong> Upon account creation, each user will receive a unique username, a temporary or initial password (which should be changed upon first login), and a <strong>Clinic ID</strong> associated with their organization. These three pieces of information (Clinic ID, username, password) are required for authentication. You agree to use only your own assigned credentials to access the Service and will not allow any other person to use your account.</p>
<p><strong>Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username, password, Clinic ID, and any two-factor authentication or security mechanisms. If you suspect that your login credentials have been lost, stolen, or compromised, or if you notice any unauthorized access to your account, you must notify <em>NotesAO </em>immediately. <em>NotesAO </em>reserves the right to suspend or reset credentials that appear compromised to protect the security of the system.</p>
<p>• <strong>User Responsibilities and Prohibited Conduct</strong></p>
<p>When using <em>NotesAO</em>, you agree to adhere to the following user responsibilities and refrain from any prohibited activities:</p>
<p><strong>Confidential Data Handling:</strong> <strong>Do not share</strong> any confidential or sensitive clinical data obtained from <em>NotesAO </em>with unauthorized people or third parties. Protected Health Information (PHI) and any personal data of clients/patients should only be accessed and used by authorized users for legitimate clinical and administrative purposes within your organization. You must comply with privacy laws (including HIPAA) when handling data from the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Authorized Access Only:</strong> You shall not attempt to access any data, accounts, or areas of the Service that you are not explicitly authorized to access. This includes refraining from attempting to bypass access controls, using another user’s credentials, or accessing other clinics’ information. Any form of hacking, penetration attempt, or unauthorized access is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>No Credential Sharing:</strong> Each user must use their own dedicated login credentials. You agree not to share your login information (Clinic ID, username, password) with colleagues, friends, or any third party. If multiple personnel in your clinic need access, each must have their own account as provisioned by <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>staff. Shared accounts are not permitted. You are responsible for all activities conducted under your credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Use of the Service:</strong> Use <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>only for its intended purpose of report generation and group-based attendance tracking for clinic sessions and programs. You must not use the Service to store or transmit any content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, obscene, or otherwise violates any law or the rights of others. <strong>Do not upload</strong> any viruses, malware, or malicious code, and do not use the Service in a manner that could damage, disable, or impair the platform (e.g., spamming, overloading the system).</p>
<p><strong>Data Accuracy and Lawful Entries:</strong> You are responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of the data you enter into <em>NotesAO</em>. You agree not to input personal information or case details into the system unless you have the proper authority and any necessary consent to do so. You also agree not to misuse the Service in any way that would violate applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to privacy laws, criminal laws (given the offender data stored), or professional conduct standards.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the above responsibilities may result in suspension or termination of your access to the Service, and in serious cases, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>(Free for Life Group PC) reserves the right to take legal action or cooperate with law enforcement as appropriate.</p>
<p>• <strong>Data Collection and Handling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Types of Data Collected:</strong> In the course of using <em>NotesAO</em>, you (the clinic and its users) will input and <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will collect/store certain personal and sensitive information about your clients and program participants. This data may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Identifiers:</strong> Full name, date of birth (DOB), and gender of each client/participant.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Phone number and email address of clients or their associated contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Program and Legal Details:</strong> Information related to the client’s involvement in programs, such as the name of their supervising officer (e.g., probation or parole officer), details of criminal offenses, and offender-victim details pertinent to the program.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Contacts:</strong> Name and contact information of emergency contact people for clients, if collected.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance and Reports:</strong> Records of group session attendance, progress notes, and any reports generated by the Service for the clinic’s operational use.</p>
<p><strong>Use and Purpose of Data:</strong> All collected data is used for the purpose of facilitating the clinic’s operations – for example, tracking attendance in mandated group sessions, generating required reports for oversight agencies, maintaining clinical records, and enabling communication with clients and relevant officials (like probation officers) as needed. <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>does <strong>not</strong> use this information for marketing or any purposes unrelated to the functioning of the Service. We will manage all such data as confidential and in accordance with our Privacy Policy (see the <em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Privacy Policy</strong> below) and applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>Clinic’s Responsibilities for Data:</strong> The subscribing clinic/organization remains the owner or custodian of the client data entered into <em>NotesAO</em>. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have obtained any necessary consents from clients to collect and store their personal information in <em>NotesAO</em>, especially in compliance with health privacy laws and any program-specific regulations. You agree that you will not input any personal data into <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>that you are not legally permitted to collect or share with us. You also agree to maintain any additional privacy notices to your clients as required by law (for example, a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices if you are a covered entity).</p>
<p><em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><strong>’s Responsibilities for Data:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em>, as a service provider and a subsidiary of Free for Life Group PC, will treat the data you store on the platform with strict confidentiality. We will not access your clinic’s data except as necessary to support and maintain the Service (for example, for backups, technical support, or as required to troubleshoot an issue) or as outlined in this Agreement and our Privacy Policy. We will not disclose client personal data to third parties except as permitted in our Privacy Policy or required by law (such as a court order). All staff at <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>who oversee customer data are trained in confidentiality and bound by appropriate agreements to protect data privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Data Confidentiality and Safeguards:</strong> Both parties (you and <em>NotesAO</em>) agree to maintain the confidentiality of the data collected via <em>NotesAO</em>. You must ensure that any data exported or printed from <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is kept secure and only shared with individuals authorized under law or your internal policies. <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>implements technical and organizational measures (detailed in the Security section below) to safeguard the data against unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>
<p>• <strong>Security Measures and Compliance</strong></p>
<p>We understand the sensitive nature of the data stored in <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and take security seriously. We implement the following security and compliance measures:</p>
<p><strong>SSL Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your device (web browser) and the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>servers is encrypted using <strong>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</strong> or equivalent strong encryption (HTTPS). This means that the information you send to the Service and receive from it is protected from eavesdropping during transit.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Hosting &amp; HIPAA-Compliant Server:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is hosted on secure servers that meet or exceed industry standards for data protection. The hosting environment and practices are designed to be <strong>HIPAA-compliant</strong>, given that <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>may oversee Protected Health Information. This includes safeguards such as encryption of data at rest, regular security audits, access controls, and backup procedures. We will enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with your clinic if required under HIPAA or otherwise ensure that our services comply with HIPAA regulations for protecting patient health information.</p>
<p><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to <em>NotesAO</em>’s servers and databases is limited to authorized <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>personnel who require it for system administration, maintenance, or support. Each such individual is bound by confidentiality obligations. Within the application, a Clinic ID segregates your clinic’s data to prevent any cross-organization data access. Users can only see data for their own clinic account and must authenticate with the correct Clinic ID, username, and password to gain access.</p>
<p><strong>No Public Access:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em>’s system is closed to the public. Only users with valid credentials issued by <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>can access the platform. There are no public-facing interfaces that allow browsing of clinic data without authentication. This reduces exposure to unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>Audit Logs:</strong> The Service maintains logs of user activities (such as logins, data entries, and edits) for security, audit, and compliance purposes. These logs help in monitoring suspicious activities and can be used to trace any unauthorized or inappropriate access, should it occur.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and its users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security. This includes U.S. healthcare privacy laws such as <strong>HIPAA</strong>. As part of HIPAA compliance, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will report any detected data breaches of unsecured PHI to the subscribing clinic in a timely manner as required by law. If your clinic is subject to other regulations (for example, 42 CFR Part 2 for substance abuse treatment records, or other state-specific laws), it is your responsibility to inform <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>so that appropriate measures or agreements can be in place.</p>
<p><strong>GDPR and International Data:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is based in the United States and primarily serves U.S. organizations. If you are using <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>to store data of individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or other regions with data protection laws like the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), please be aware that <strong>GDPR compliance is under evaluation</strong>. We currently have not finalized our GDPR compliance program. You should not input EU resident personal data into <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>unless you have assessed the compliance requirements. We plan to update our policies and measures in the future to address GDPR; until then, use of the Service for EU personal data is at your discretion and risk. (See the Privacy Policy for more information on data rights and international transfers.)</p>
<p>By using <em>NotesAO</em>, you acknowledge these security measures and agree that they are appropriate for the types of data being stored. You also agree to play your part in security – for example, using strong passwords, keeping devices secure, and notifying us of any incidents.</p>
<p>• <strong>Subscription Fees and Payment Terms</strong></p>
<p>Use of the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>Service is subject to the payment of subscription fees as agreed between your clinic and <em>NotesAO</em>. By entering into this Agreement and using the Service, you agree to pay the applicable fees and abide by the following terms:</p>
<p><strong>Onboarding Fee:</strong> There is a one-time <strong>onboarding fee of $500</strong>. This fee covers account setup for your clinic, initial configuration, training or support during onboarding, and other activation-related services. The onboarding fee is typically due before or at the commencement of service. It is <strong>non-refundable</strong> once account setup work has begun, except as otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
<p><strong>Subscription Fee:</strong> The Service carries a recurring subscription fee of <strong>$</strong><strong>X</strong><strong> per month</strong> for the standard package (which includes the provision of 2 admin accounts and up to fifteen member accounts for users in your clinic, as noted in the Account Creation section). This subscription fee is charged in advance for each monthly billing cycle (unless an alternative billing period is agreed, such as annual billing). Taxes may be added to these fees if applicable (e.g., sales or use tax) as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Billing and Payment:</strong> Payments will be invoiced or charged automatically (depending on your arrangement, e.g., credit card on file or invoicing) at the start of each billing period. You agree to provide current and accurate billing information and to promptly update any changes (such as a new credit card number or address). If paying by invoice, payment is due within the period stated (e.g., net 30 days) from the invoice date. Past due payments may incur interest or late fees at the maximum rate permitted by Texas law.</p>
<p><strong>No Public Charges:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>does not offer a free public version of the Service. All accounts must be part of a paid subscription maintained by an organization. There is no self-service signup; thus, all use implies that your organization is subscribed and paying the fees.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Payment and Suspension:</strong> If subscription payments are not received on time, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>reserves the right to suspend access to the Service for your clinic’s users. Prior to suspension, we will provide a notice (e.g., an email to the admin contacts) and a short grace period. If fees remain unpaid beyond an extended period (e.g., 30 days past due), <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>may terminate your account for breach of this Agreement. Reactivation after a suspension for non-payment may incur reactivation fees or require payment of any outstanding amounts.</p>
<p><strong>Fee Changes:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>may adjust the subscription fees or introduce new fees for additional features in the future. Any changes to fees will be communicated to you with at least 30 days’ notice. If you do not agree with a fee change, you may choose to cancel your subscription before the new fees take effect (see <strong>Termination</strong> below for cancellation terms). Continued use of the Service after the fee change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the new amount.</p>
<p>For additional details on billing procedures, refunds, and cancellation, please refer to the <em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Terms of Service (TOS)</strong> document, which further outlines operational policies. The fees and payment terms in this EUA are subject to those detailed policies.</p>
<p>• <strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p>
<p>All content, software, technology, documentation, and intellectual property relating to the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>Service are owned by or licensed to <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>(Free for Life Group PC) and are protected by intellectual property laws. This includes the platform’s code, databases, interface design, logos, trademarks, and any materials provided to you as part of the Service (collectively, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>IP).</p>
<p><strong>License to Use:</strong> Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and payment of all applicable fees, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to access and use the Service for your clinic’s internal business purposes (specifically, for group attendance tracking and report generation) during the term of your subscription. No other rights or licenses are granted. You may not use <em>NotesAO</em>’s logos or branding without prior written permission except as needed for identification of the service.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> You shall <strong>not</strong> do or attempt to do any of the following with respect to the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>platform or content, except to the extent expressly permitted by <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>in writing or by law (and then only after providing <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>with written notice):</p>
<p>Modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based on any part of the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>Service or software.</p>
<p>Copy, reproduce, or distribute any portion of the software, interface, or documentation to any third party (other than internal distribution of allowed reports or exports for legitimate clinic use). For clarity: authorized users may export or print reports/data for official use within the scope of the Service (e.g., submitting an attendance report to a court as required), but you may not share or sublicense the software or platform itself to others.</p>
<p>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>software, except to the limited extent that applicable law permits despite this restriction.</p>
<p>Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices present in the platform interface or outputs.</p>
<p>Reselling, lease, lend, or provide access to the Service to any third party outside your organization. Your license is for your clinic’s internal use only. You cannot use <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>to provide time-sharing services or as a service bureau for others who are not covered by your subscription.</p>
<p>All rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved by <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and its licensors. If you are aware of any unauthorized use of <em>NotesAO</em>’s intellectual property (for example, someone pirating the software or using it without permission), you agree to notify us.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> If you provide any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, or other feedback regarding the Service to <em>NotesAO</em>, we may use and incorporate such feedback without any obligation to you. Any improvements or modifications to the Service based on your feedback are solely owned by <em>NotesAO</em>.</p>
<p>• <strong>Disclaimers of Warranty</strong></p>
<p><strong>“As Is” and “As Available” Service:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>provides the Service to you on an “<strong>as is</strong>” and “<strong>as available</strong>” basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>(and its parent company Free for Life Group PC, and all its officers, employees, and agents) <strong>denies</strong><strong> all warranties and representations</strong>, express or implied, relating to the Service and your use of it. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p><strong>Implied Warranties:</strong> All implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement are denied. We do not warrant that the Service will meet your specific requirements or that it will operate error-free or uninterrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy and Reliability:</strong> While <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>aims to provide a reliable and useful platform, we make no guarantee that the data, reports, or outputs will be error-free or that any errors in the software will be corrected immediately. The accuracy of data entered (e.g., attendance records or personal info) is the responsibility of the users entering that data.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> We implement security measures as described above; however, we do not warrant that the Service is invulnerable to all security breaches or cyber-attacks. We will use reasonable care and follow industry practices, but we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Integrations:</strong> If the Service integrates or is used in conjunction with any third-party systems or software (for example, a reporting system for a government agency or an email service for notifications), <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>makes no warranties regarding those third-party services. Any issues or downtime caused by third-party components are outside of <em>NotesAO</em>’s control.</p>
<p><strong>No Professional Advice:</strong> Any information or templates provided within <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>(for example, report templates, attendance summaries, or suggested workflows) are for support purposes only. <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>does not provide legal, medical, or professional advice via the software. You are responsible for how you use the data and reports generated. Always verify that outputs meet your regulatory requirements (such as court report standards) independently.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such cases, any implied warranties are limited to the minimum scope and duration permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>• <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and Free for Life Group PC (including their respective employees, officers, directors, affiliates, and agents) will <strong>not be liable</strong> for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or use, or cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use <em>NotesAO</em><em>”</em>. This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage.</p>
<p>But without limiting the generality of the above, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>shall not be liable for:</p>
<p><strong>Data Loss or Damage:</strong> any loss, damage, or corruption of data (including client records or attendance data) that occurs in connection with the use of the Service. We highly recommend that you keep separate backups or exports of critical data as needed. While <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>does regular backups for disaster recovery, we do not guarantee that a particular piece of data can be restored in the event of accidental deletion or corruption.</p>
<p><strong>Service Interruptions:</strong> any downtime or unavailability of the Service, whether due to maintenance, technical issues, force majeure events (e.g., power outages, natural disasters), or cyber-attacks. While we strive for high availability, <strong>uptime is not guaranteed</strong>. Any planned maintenance that could cause downtime will be communicated in advance, when possible, but we are not liable for any losses due to Service interruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Unauthorized Access or Security Breach:</strong> any unauthorized access, hacking, or security breach that occurs despite our safeguards, except to the extent caused by our gross negligence or willful misconduct. (In the unfortunate event of a data breach, we will follow our legal obligations such as notifying affected customers under HIPAA or other laws, but we may not be liable for resulting damages if we were not negligent.)</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Acts:</strong> any acts or omissions of third parties, such as internet providers, hosting services, integrated third-party software, or users of your account. For example, if an authorized user in your clinic misuses the system or shares data inappropriately, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is not liable for the consequences of that action.</p>
<p><strong>Cap on Liability:</strong> To the extent that any liability is not legally excludable under applicable law, the total cumulative liability of <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and Free for Life Group PC to you (for any and all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Service) shall <strong>not exceed the amount of fees actually paid by you to </strong><em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim</strong>. If no fees have been paid (for example, during a trial or if fees were waived), <em>NotesAO</em>’s liability is capped at $100. This limitation applies whether the claims are based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory.</p>
<p><strong>Basis of Bargain:</strong> You acknowledge that <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>has set its prices and entered into this Agreement in reliance on the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of liability stated herein, which reflect an allocation of risk between the parties and form an essential basis of the bargain. These provisions will survive and apply even if any remedy is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
<p>• <strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (the clinic and its authorized users) agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless <em>NotesAO</em>, Free for Life Group PC, and their affiliates and respective officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with:</p>
<p>Your violation of this EUA or misuse of the Service (including any data or content input by you or activities under your accounts).</p>
<p>Your violation of any law or regulation (for example, if you use <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>in a way that breaches confidentiality laws, data protection laws, or any other applicable regulations).</p>
<p>Any claims relating to the data you input or manage through <em>NotesAO</em>, including claims that personal information was collected or disclosed by you without proper rights or consent, or that such data infringes on someone’s rights (e.g., if you upload content, you have no right to use).</p>
<p><em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>reserves the right, at its discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim, and you will not settle any such claim without our prior written consent. Your indemnification obligation will survive any termination of this Agreement or your use of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>10. </strong><strong>Termination of Service</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the Customer:</strong> You may stop using <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and request termination of this Agreement at any time by providing written notice to <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>(for example, via an email to our support or sales contact). If you terminate a subscription in the middle of a billing cycle, the termination will be effective at the end of the current paid period unless otherwise agreed. (Please refer to the <strong>Terms of Service</strong> for detailed cancellation policy and whether any pro-rated refunds apply. The onboarding fee is non-refundable, and monthly fees are not prorated on mid-month termination.)</p>
<p><strong>By </strong><em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><em><strong>”</strong></em><strong>:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>may suspend or terminate your access to the Service and this Agreement for violations of the terms herein, for non-payment of fees, or if required to do so by law (for example, if providing the Service to you becomes unlawful). We will strive to provide notice and an opportunity to cure any breach if feasible. In cases of severe breach (e.g., a serious violation of data security rules or misuse of the system) or if required by law enforcement, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>may terminate or suspend immediately without notice. Additionally, if at any time <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>decides to discontinue the Service entirely, we will give you as much advance notice as reasonably possible (e.g., 60 days’ notice of shutdown).</p>
<p><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination of the Agreement, your rights to access and use <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>cease. <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will disable your accounts and you and your users must stop using the platform. Data export: We will provide you the opportunity to retrieve your clinic’s data from the Service, either before the termination effective date or within a defined period after termination (e.g., within 30 days after end of service). After such period, we may delete your data from our live systems, except to the extent retention is required by law or specified by separate agreement. Our obligations under the Privacy Policy to maintain the confidentiality of your data continue to apply to any retained data. All provisions of this EUA which by their nature should survive termination (such as disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnity, governing law) shall survive.</p>
<p><strong>11. </strong><strong>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Governing Law:</strong> This Agreement and any disputes arising out of or related to it, or the Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>State of Texas</strong>, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> You agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in <strong>Tarrant County, Texas</strong> (which is the county including Fort Worth), and you hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts. If you are located outside the United States, you understand and agree that you are voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of Texas courts as a condition of using the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration and Mediation:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>values dispute resolution in a fair and cost-effective manner. At our sole discretion, we may require any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Service that cannot be resolved informally to be submitted to <strong>binding arbitration</strong>. Such arbitration would be conducted in Fort Worth, Texas, in English, and administered by a neutral arbitration organization agreed upon by the parties (or, if the parties cannot agree, by the American Arbitration Association “AAA”) under its applicable rules. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party will bear its own costs in arbitration, and share the arbitrator’s fees equally, unless the arbitrator finds the claim to be frivolous or brought in bad faith, in which case the arbitrator may award costs and attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. <strong>Important:</strong> By agreeing to arbitration, both you and <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>are waiving the right to a trial in court and to have claims heard by a judge or jury.</p>
<p>Before initiating arbitration or any legal action, the parties agree to first attempt <strong>good-faith negotiation/mediation</strong>. Either party may request a mediation session with a neutral mediator to resolve the dispute amicably. If mediation is undertaken, each party will bear its own costs and share the mediator’s fees equally.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section prevents either party from seeking injunctive relief in a court of law in instances of unauthorized use of intellectual property, breach of confidentiality, or other urgent matters where interim relief is required to prevent serious harm.</p>
<p><strong>12. </strong><strong>HIPAA Compliance</strong></p>
<p>Because <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is used in a healthcare and counseling context and may involve Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the following provisions apply:</p>
<p><strong>Business Associate Obligations:</strong> Free for Life Group PC/<em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>may be considered a “Business Associate” to your clinic (if you are a Covered Entity under HIPAA). We are committed to complying with all applicable provisions of the HIPAA regulations regarding the privacy and security of PHI. If required, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will enter into a separate Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with your organization, which will be incorporated by reference into this EUA. In the event of any conflict between this EUA and the BAA in matters relating to PHI, the BAA will control.</p>
<p><strong>Use and Disclosure of PHI:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will not use or disclose PHI except as permitted to perform the Service, as allowed by law, or as instructed by you in accordance with the BAA and HIPAA. De-identified information (as defined by HIPAA) may be used for Service improvement or analytics, but only if all identifiers have been removed by the HIPAA de-identification standards.</p>
<p><strong>Safeguards:</strong> We have in place administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI, as described in the Security section of this Agreement. We regularly review our security practices to ensure HIPAA compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Breach Notification:</strong> In the event of a breach of unsecured PHI that we manage on your behalf, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will notify you without unreasonable delay and provide information about the breach in accordance with HIPAA’s breach notification requirements. We will cooperate in your breach response efforts as outlined in the BAA.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Necessary:</strong> When processing PHI, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will make efforts to access or use only the minimum necessary information required to accomplish the intended purpose, in line with HIPAA’s minimum necessary rule.</p>
<p>Your clinic is responsible for its own HIPAA compliance as a Covered Entity, including obtaining any patient authorizations or consents if you input PHI into <em>NotesAO</em>, and providing any required notices to individuals. By using <em>NotesAO</em>, you represent that you have authority to allow <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>to function as a Business Associate and handle PHI for the purposes of providing the service.</p>
<p><strong>13. </strong><strong>Other Compliance and Regulatory Considerations</strong></p>
<p><strong>GDPR and Data Protection (Non-U.S. Users):</strong> As noted, <em>NotesAO</em>’s compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is currently being developed. If you are subject to GDPR or similar international data protection laws, you should contact <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>to discuss whether and how the Service can meet those requirements. We may update our policies to address GDPR in the future and will inform you of any significant changes. For now, by using the Service, you acknowledge that data will be stored in the U.S. and governed by U.S./Texas law, and you have assessed any risk or requirements that entails.</p>
<p><strong>Other Laws:</strong> You agree to use <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>in compliance with all other applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to laws relating to mental health records, victim confidentiality, and criminal justice data (as your use case may involve offender and victim information). If your program is subject to specific state regulations or grants (for example, BIPP program standards in Texas or other state’s domestic violence intervention program rules), you are responsible for ensuring that use of <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>aligns with those requirements. We encourage you to inform us of any special compliance needs so we can assist or clarify how our service can support compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Export Controls:</strong> The software and Service may be subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws. You agree not to export or re-export any part of the Service, or any technical data related thereto, except in compliance with U.S. laws. (This is not relevant for most clinic usage, but we include it for completeness.)</p>
<p><strong>14. </strong><strong>Amendments and Updates to this Agreement</strong></p>
<p><em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>may update or modify this End User Agreement from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify the primary contacts of our client clinics (for example, via email or through an in-app notice) and/or post the updated Agreement on our website or within the platform with a new “Last Updated” date. It is your responsibility to review any updated Agreement. Continued use of the Service after an update constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the Service and may terminate the Agreement as described above.</p>
<p>No amendment to or waiver of any portion of this Agreement will be binding on <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of <em>NotesAO</em>.</p>
<p><strong>15. </strong><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>This EUA, together with the Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service, and any applicable Business Associate Agreement or Order Form, constitutes the entire agreement between you and <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>regarding the use of the Service. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Service or any other subject matter covered by this EUA. In the event of a conflict between this EUA and other policies (like the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), the documents will prevail in the following order: Business Associate Agreement (if applicable) -&gt; End User Agreement -&gt; Terms of Service -&gt; Privacy Policy, unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of the Agreement will remain in full force. No waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement will constitute a subsequent waiver of the same or any other term of the Agreement.</p>

<p><em><strong>17. </strong></em><em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>17.1 </strong><strong>Last Updated: [</strong><strong>May 6</strong><strong>, 2025]</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how <em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em>(a subsidiary of Free for Life Group PC) collects, uses, stores, and discloses personal information when you use our Service. It also outlines your rights regarding your personal data. This policy is intended for the clinics that subscribe to <em>NotesAO</em>, their authorized users, and any individuals whose data may be stored in the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>system (such as clinic clients/participants). We are committed to safeguarding all personal and sensitive information in our custody in compliance with applicable laws, including healthcare and privacy regulations.</p>
<p>By using <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>or providing us with personal information in connection with the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service or provide personal data.</p>
<p><strong>17.2</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>We (on behalf of our client clinics) collect and maintain several types of information through the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>platform. This includes information you actively enter the system and information that may be collected automatically as you use the Service.</p>
<p><strong>1. Personal Information Provided by Users (Client Data):</strong> These are data fields about individuals (clients/patients and related persons) that clinic staff input into <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>for the purpose of attendance tracking and report generation. This typically includes:</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Information:</strong> Full name of participants/clients, Date of Birth, and gender.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Details:</strong> Phone number and email address of the participant, and their physical address if needed for records (even though not explicitly listed, some clinics may input addresses or ZIP codes as part of client profiles).</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Contact Information:</strong> Name and phone number/email of an emergency contact person for the participant (if the clinic collects this for safety purposes).</p>
<p><strong>Program-Related Details:</strong> The name of the supervising officer or referring officer (e.g., probation officer, parole officer, or case manager associated with the participant), details of the participant’s criminal offenses relevant to the program, and any offender-victim details recorded as part of intake (for example, whether a particular victim is associated, or legal case identifiers).</p>
<p><strong>Session and Attendance Data:</strong> Records of group session attendance (dates present, absences, reasons for absence, etc.), session notes or progress comments, and any completion status or outcomes (such as successful completion of a program, or termination).</p>
<p><strong>Reports and Assessments:</strong> Any reports generated by the system that contain personal information (e.g., attendance summaries, compliance reports for courts or probation departments, behavioral assessments entered by facilitators, etc.). These reports often compile the above information in a formatted way.</p>
<p><em>Important:</em> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>acts as a data processor for this information, meaning we host and manage it on behalf of the clinic (the data controller). The clinic is responsible for ensuring it has the right to collect this information from individuals and to input it into <em>NotesAO</em>.</p>
<p><strong>2. User Account Information:</strong> For those using the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>platform (clinic staff, facilitators, admins), we collect information required to create and manage user accounts, such as:</p>
<p>Full name of the user</p>
<p>Work email address</p>
<p>Work phone number (if provided)</p>
<p>Role or title (for example, LPC facilitator, admin, etc.)</p>
<p>Username assigned and password (stored in an encrypted form – <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>never stores raw plaintext passwords)</p>
<p>Clinic affiliation (the Clinic ID and organization name you are associated with)</p>
<p>This information is used for authentication, authorization, and contacting you regarding your use of the Service (for instance, sending a password reset link or important account notices).</p>
<p><strong>3. Automatically Collected Information:</strong> When authorized users access <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>(typically via a web browser), the system may automatically collect certain technical information to improve the user experience and maintain security, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Device and Log Information:</strong> IP address from which you access the service, browser type, device type (e.g., desktop, tablet), operating system, and timestamps of access. We log actions like login attempts, data entries, and errors for security auditing and troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect metadata on how the platform is used, e.g., which features are used most frequently, performance metrics, and general usage patterns. This data is usually aggregated and <strong>does not include</strong> the actual content of your entries, but rather information like how often reports are generated, or the number of logins per day, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Session Data:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>uses session cookies (small text files stored in your browser) to maintain your logged-in session. These cookies are essential for security (to keep you logged in as you navigate the platform) and are not used for advertising or tracking outside of the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>environment. The cookies we set contain an encrypted token identifying your session and your preferences (like interface settings). They expire after a certain time of inactivity or when you log out. We do not use third-party analytics or advertising cookies on the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>app portion that oversees sensitive data.</p>
<p><strong>4. Support and Correspondence:</strong> If you contact <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>support or communicate with us (via email, phone, or support tickets), we may keep records of that communication. This could include your contact information, the nature of the question or issue, and any screenshots or attachments you send. We use this information solely to assist you and improve the Service.</p>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect any data from end-users outside of the above context. <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is not directed to general consumers or minors for independent use. All data pertains to either professionals using the system or clients of those professionals.</p>
<p><strong>17.3 </strong><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p><em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and Free for Life Group PC use the collected information for the following purposes, all in support of providing and improving our Service:</p>
<p><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> We use client personal data (names, contact info, offenses, etc.) to populate the application’s functions – for example, to display a participant roster for a session, to generate attendance reports with the participant’s name and details, and to allow authorized users to record and review information about each client. The data you input drives the core functionality of <em>NotesAO</em>, and we process it as needed to fulfill the service’s purpose for you.</p>
<p><strong>Administration and User Authentication:</strong> User account info (like username, password, Clinic ID) is used to authenticate users and ensure only authorized access to data. We also use your contact information (email/phone) to send vital account notifications, such as login alerts, password resets, multi-factor authentication codes (if implemented), and service announcements (e.g., planned downtime notices).</p>
<p><strong>Communications:</strong> We might use the contact information provided (email or phone number of users, or participants’ contact info if used by the system) for communications strictly related to the service. For example, we may send:</p>
<p><strong>Service Updates:</strong> Emails to admin users about new features, changes in policy, or tips for using <em>NotesAO</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Support Responses:</strong> If you reach out for help, we will use your contact info to reply.</p>
<p><strong>Alerts:</strong> In-app or email alerts can be sent to facilitators/admins regarding certain events (like a reminder that a report is due or notification of a missed session logged).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> We do not send marketing newsletters to client participants or use their info for any promotion. Communications with participants (if any) are initiated by the clinic users through the platform’s functionality (for example, if the platform allows sending a reminder to a participant’s email, it is at the user’s action).</p>
<p><strong>Improvement and Analytics:</strong> We may use aggregated and anonymized usage data to understand how <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is performing and how users interact with it. For instance, we might analyze overall login frequencies, or the average number of sessions tracked per clinic, to help plan system capacity or guide interface improvements. Any analysis is done on <strong>non-identifiable</strong> data (we remove personal identifiers or aggregate data across many clinics). This helps us improve features, fix bugs, and optimize user experience. (Per the EUA, any use of data for these purposes will ensure individuals are not identifiable.)</p>
<p><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> Information like IP addresses, log-in attempts, and audit logs are used to monitor suspicious activities. For example, we might detect if there are repeated failed logins or logins from a new location and alert the user or temporarily lock the account to prevent unauthorized access. We also use this data to debug issues (e.g., if an error occurs, logs help us trace the cause) and to protect the integrity of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may process and retain personal information as required to comply with legal obligations. For example, keeping certain records for regulatory compliance, responding to lawful requests by public authorities (like subpoenas or court orders), or fulfilling our obligations in a Business Associate Agreement under HIPAA (like reporting breaches or providing accounting of disclosures if applicable).</p>
<p>We will not use personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected unless we obtain your consent or as required/allowed by law. We do not sell personal data to third parties. We do not use client data for advertising or any unrelated commercial purposes.</p>
<p><strong>17.4 </strong><strong>How We Share or Disclose Information</strong></p>
<p><em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>understands that the information entered our system is sensitive and confidential. We only share or disclose information in a limited set of circumstances:</p>
<p><strong>With the Clinic and Authorized Users:</strong> Obviously, data that a particular clinic’s staff input into <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is shared among that clinic’s authorized users through the application. For example, a facilitator enters attendance data which an admin can later see in a report. This “sharing” is an intended part of the service operation. Each user within a clinic can see the data for that clinic, subject to any role-based permissions configured.</p>
<p><strong>With Service Providers (Subprocessors):</strong> We may utilize trusted third-party companies to support the infrastructure and operations of <em>NotesAO</em>. Examples include:</p>
<p><strong>Hosting and Cloud Storage Providers:</strong> (e.g., a data center or cloud service like AWS, Azure, etc.) that stores the database and files. These providers have access to data only for the purpose of storage and computing on our behalf and are <strong>bound by strict agreements to maintain security and confidentiality</strong>, consistent with HIPAA requirements if PHI is involved.</p>
<p><strong>Email/SMS Gateways:</strong> if our system sends emails or text messages (for alerts or notifications), we use third-party communication services to transmit those messages. They would receive the necessary data like the email address or phone number and message content.</p>
<p><strong>IT and Security Services:</strong> We may use services for backup storage, monitoring, or security scanning. If they encounter personal data as part of backups or logs, they are also bound to confidentiality.</p>
<p>We only share the minimum necessary information with these service providers for them to perform their functions, and they are not allowed to use the data for any other purpose. We conduct due diligence to ensure they meet high data protection standards. A list of current subprocessors can be provided upon request.</p>
<p><strong>Within Free for Life Group</strong><strong> PC</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is part of Free for Life Group PC, so we may share information with our parent organization and affiliates <strong>only as needed</strong> for business operations (such as internal administration, billing, or combined services). All Free for Life Group PC personnel with access are subject to the same privacy and security commitments. They will only access data if necessary to support <em>NotesAO</em>’s function or if you are also receiving services directly from Free for Life Group PC that require that data.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Requirements and Protection:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
<p>Comply with a legal obligation, such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant. (If a law enforcement or regulatory request is received for client data, we will, where permitted, notify the affected clinic to allow them to object or seek protection, unless legally prohibited from doing so.)</p>
<p>Protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>(Free for Life Group PC), our customers, or others. This includes enforcing our agreements or investigating potential violations thereof.</p>
<p>In the context of HIPAA: We will comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s requirements for any mandatory disclosures (e.g., to the Department of Health and Human Services during an audit) and permissive disclosures (like for public health or law enforcement purposes) only as allowed by law and typically in coordination with the covered entity (the clinic).</p>
<p><strong>Business Transactions:</strong> In the unlikely event that <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>or Free for Life Group PC participates in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or other business reorganization, your information (including personal data) may be among the assets transferred to the buyer or new entity. If such a transfer occurs, we will ensure the successor entity is bound to respect the terms of this Privacy Policy and that you are notified of any change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Outside of the scenarios above, we would only share personal information with third parties if you (or the relevant individual) have given us explicit consent to do so. For example, if a particular integration or third-party service is requested by a customer clinic (like connecting <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>data to another system via API or data export), we would do so only with permission and under appropriate safeguards.</p>
<p><strong>No Unauthorized Disclosure:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third-party marketers or advertisers. We do not use or disclose any client data for purposes that constitute a violation of HIPAA or other privacy laws. All sharing is limited and purposeful as described.</p>
<p><strong>17.5</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Data Storage and Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Storage Location:</strong> All data entered into <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is stored on secure servers, which are currently located in the United States. Primary hosting is in [for example, an accredited Tier III data center or a major cloud provider’s U.S. region]. If we ever need to store or process data outside of the U.S., we will update this policy and ensure lawful transfer mechanisms (for example, standard contractual clauses for EU data, once GDPR compliance is fully addressed).</p>
<p><strong>Encryption:</strong> We employ encryption to protect data:</p>
<p><strong>In Transit:</strong> Any communication between your browser and our servers is protected by SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS). This means personal data transmitted during login and usage (names, IDs, etc.) is encrypted so that a third-party intercepting traffic cannot read it.</p>
<p><strong>At Rest:</strong> We also encrypt sensitive data at rest in our databases and storage or use filesystem and database-level encryption features. For instance, any field deemed particularly sensitive (like passwords, which are hashed; or files, if any, that are uploaded) are stored in encrypted form. Full database encryption or disk encryption is in place on our servers to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>Access Controls and Organizational Measures:</strong> Access to production data is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need (for example, a system administrator or a support engineer investigating a specific issue for a customer). These personnel undergo background checks and sign confidentiality agreements. Within the application, your clinic’s users only see your clinic’s data. Internally, any access to customer data by <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>staff (for support or maintenance) is logged and only done when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Security Protocols:</strong> We have implemented various security protocols and practices, including:</p>
<p><strong>Firewalls and Network Security:</strong> Our servers are protected by firewalls and monitored for intrusion attempts. We regularly update software and apply security patches to guard against vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Alerts:</strong> We use monitoring tools to detect unusual patterns such as multiple failed logins, heavy load indicative of an attack, or other anomalies. Automated alerts and our security team’s oversight help us respond quickly to potential issues.</p>
<p><strong>Regular Audits and Assessments:</strong> We conduct periodic security audits and risk assessments. This may include external penetration testing by security experts to evaluate the strength of our system. Any identified issues are remediated promptly.</p>
<p><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong> Data is backed up on a regular schedule (for example, nightly backups stored securely). Backups are encrypted and stored in a separate secure location. This helps ensure that, in case of hardware failure or other disaster, we can restore data. Backup data is protected with the same care as live data.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Policies:</strong> All <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>(Free for Life Group PC) employees with access to sensitive data receive training in data privacy and security best practices, including HIPAA training. We maintain internal policies on how to oversee sensitive information, and we enforce those policies.</p>
<p><strong>Retention of Data:</strong> (This overlaps with Data Retention below, but to address storage) We store personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by your clinic or applicable law. Active client data will be stored throughout the duration of the clinic’s subscription. See the<strong> Data</strong><strong> Retention</strong> section for more details on retention periods.</p>
<p><strong>Breach Response:</strong> Despite strong security measures, no system is immune to all threats. In the event of a data breach or security incident that affects personal data, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will follow applicable laws in notifying affected parties. If PHI is involved, we will follow HIPAA breach notification rules, which require notifying the covered entity (the clinic) without unreasonable delay so that you can in turn notify patients as needed. We will also investigate the incident, mitigate any further risks, and take steps to prevent future occurrences.</p>
<p>By using <em>NotesAO</em>, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks in data storage and online transmission. However, know that we are committed to protecting your data and will treat it with the utmost care and security.</p>
<p><strong>17.6 </strong><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We retain personal data only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by law or by agreement with you. Because <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is often used as a system-of-record for attendance and compliance data, retention can be important for legal or clinical reasons. Here is how we approach retention:</p>
<p><strong>Active Subscription Data:</strong> For as long as your clinic remains an active subscriber of <em>NotesAO</em><em>”</em>, all data you have entered into the system will be retained and available on the platform (unless you delete certain records through the interface, in which case those deleted records may be removed from active view, though we might keep backups as described below). We do not delete or purge data while you are using the service unless instructed by you or required (except for test/sample data that might be cleared during onboarding as part of setup).</p>
<p><strong>Termination of Service:</strong> If your clinic’s subscription ends (either by cancellation or termination), we will typically retain your data in our systems for a limited <strong>grace period</strong> after termination – often <strong>30 to 60 days</strong> – to allow for data export or account reactivation if needed. During this period, your account may be deactivated, but the data is not yet deleted. Upon your request, we can assist with exporting data in a generic format (e.g., CSV reports or PDF documents of reports) for your records.</p>
<p><strong>Deletion After Termination:</strong> After the grace period post-termination, we will proceed to delete or anonymize the personal data associated with your account in our production systems. This usually involves permanently deleting database records for participants and users and wiping or anonymizing any residual data in logs that can identify your clinic or individuals. We may retain some minimal information for internal recordkeeping such as the fact of your organization’s name, the dates of service, and billing records, but not the detailed client personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Backup Retention:</strong> Our backup files that contain personal data (from either active or terminated accounts) are retained for a certain rotation period (for example, backups might be kept for up to 90 days before being overwritten or deleted). Thus, it is possible that after we delete data from our live database, it could remain in encrypted backups for a brief period until those backups cycle out. We store backups securely, and if we must restore data from a backup for disaster recovery, we will re-delete any data for terminated accounts that should have been purged.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Requirements for Retention:</strong> In some cases, we might be required by law to retain certain data for a longer period. For instance, if a law enforcement request or legal hold is in place related to your data, we will retain the data as directed. Or, if relevant laws mandate that certain transaction logs be kept (for example, under financial regulations or specific healthcare statutes), we comply with those requirements. Additionally, as a Business Associate under HIPAA, we may be required to return or destroy PHI at the end of our relationship unless retention is required by law. If destruction is infeasible (e.g., stored in backups), we will extend protections to that data and prevent further use.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated/Anonymized Data:</strong> Any aggregated analytics data that does not identify individuals or your organization may be retained indefinitely for our use (e.g., system performance metrics, generic usage statistics). This data no longer has personal identifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing Programs:</strong> If your clinic re-subscribes or maintains certain continuing programs, we can retain historical data as needed. By default, we assume continuous retention during active use; we only purge after a clear termination or at your specific request.</p>
<p>We aim to be flexible: if you have specific retention needs or policies (for example, you want us to delete certain records earlier, or conversely you need data retained longer for compliance reasons), please contact us to discuss and we will try to accommodate reasonable requests, possibly under an addendum or custom agreement.</p>
<p><strong>17.7 </strong><strong>Your Rights and Choices</strong></p>
<p>We strive to give you control over your personal information. Depending on your role (clinic administrator, facilitator, or an individual whose data is stored) and applicable law, you, or the individuals whose data you manage may have the following rights:</p>
<p><strong>Access and Review:</strong> Authorized users of the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>system can directly access and review the personal data stored about clients and themselves via the platform’s interface. For example, you can view or search participant records, attendance logs, and your profile information. If you need a comprehensive export of data (for instance, exporting all a particular client’s records), you can request this from <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>support, and we will assist you in obtaining the data in a readable format (subject to proper authorization).</p>
<p><strong>Correction and Updates:</strong> If you find that any personal data in <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is inaccurate or outdated, you could correct it. Users can edit records through the interface (for instance, updating a client’s contact number or fixing a typo in a name). For user account info, admins can update names or contact info, or our support can assist. We encourage clinics to keep data up to date. If for some reason you are unable to make a correction yourself, you may contact us, and we will correct the information as directed by the data owner (the clinic).</p>
<p><strong>Deletion and Erasure:</strong> You may request deletion of personal data. Within the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>interface, there may be functionality to delete certain records (like removing a participant who was entered in error). Deleting data will typically archive or remove it from active view. For complete erasure, a clinic admin can request that we permanently delete certain data from our systems. <strong>Important:</strong> Because clinics might have legal obligations to retain certain records (for example, proof of attendance in a court-mandated program), we advise caution in deleting data. We will confirm such requests with authorized personnel. If a participant (data subject) requests deletion of their own data, we will refer that request to the clinic (since the clinic controls the data). If the clinic approves deletion and it is lawful to do so, we will assist in erasing the data. Note that some data may not be deletable immediately if it is intertwined with system logs or backups (see Data Retention above), but we will process deletions in the next purge cycle or backup rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to obtain a copy of personal data in a portable format. We can provide exports (e.g., CSV, PDF, or other common formats) of data upon request. For example, if you decide to leave the service, we will help you export your data so you can transfer it elsewhere. Similarly, if an individual whose data is in the system asked for a copy of their data (and you as the clinic approve it), you can use <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>to generate reports that contain their info or ask us for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> In contexts where consent is the basis for data collection (if applicable), an individual can withdraw consent. However, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>typically operates under the clinic’s authority (e.g., as part of program participation or legal requirement, not solely consent). If a participant withdraws consent for their data to be in <em>NotesAO</em>, the clinic should inform us and discontinue using the system for that individual. We will comply by deleting or anonymizing that individual’s data if instructed by the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>Objection to Processing:</strong> If an individual objects to certain processing (for example, an EU individual might object under GDPR to certain uses of data), we will assess such objection. Since we do not use data for marketing or unrelated purposes, this is unlikely to be an issue. Any objection should be directed at the clinic first, and we will cooperate as needed.</p>
<p><strong>California Privacy Rights:</strong> If applicable (e.g., if any data subject is a California resident and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applies), that individual might have rights to know what personal data is collected, to access it, and to request deletion or opt-out of certain sharing. <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is a service provider to the clinic in CCPA terms. We do not sell personal information. We will support our clinics in fulfilling any verified CCPA requests. For instance, if a California participant wants to know what info is held on them, we can help the clinic gather that information for disclosure.</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights or make inquiries about your personal data, you should primarily contact your clinic administrator (for client participants) or use the tools provided on the platform. Clinic administrators can contact <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>support at any time to assist with data requests (email: support@<em>NotesAO</em>.com). We may need to verify the identity of the requestor and confirm authorization (especially for deletion requests) to ensure privacy and security (we would not want to delete or expose data improperly at the request of an unauthorized person).</p>
<p>Please note that certain rights may not be absolute. For example, if fulfilling a deletion request conflicts with a legal obligation (like maintaining records for a funding requirement or a legal dispute), we will inform you that we cannot delete the data immediately and explain the reason. We will not discriminate or retaliate against anyone for exercising their private rights.</p>
<p><strong>17.8 </strong><strong>International Users and GDPR</strong></p>
<p>As of the last update of this policy, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is primarily focused on U.S.-based clients and thus operates under U.S. law (with a strong emphasis on HIPAA for healthcare data). <strong>GDPR compliance is currently being evaluated and developed.</strong></p>
<p>If you are in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or other regions with data protection laws, please be aware of the following:</p>
<p>The personal information collected through <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will be transferred to and stored in the United States. The U.S. may not have the same level of data protection as your home jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We are working towards implementing GDPR-compliant measures, such as Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfer, a GDPR-ready Data Processing Addendum, and fulfilling all GDPR data subject rights. However, these may not be fully in place yet.</p>
<p>If your organization is subject to GDPR and you wish to use <em>NotesAO</em>, please contact us to discuss data protection arrangements. We may be able to put interim measures in place or ensure contract terms that address EU requirements.</p>
<p>Until our GDPR compliance is finalized, by using <em>NotesAO</em>, you (the clinic) are acknowledging the status and may need to obtain consent or other legal basis from individuals for transferring their data to us in the U.S. We recommend not entering data of EU residents into <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>unless you have the proper legal basis and have informed those individuals.</p>
<p>Once our GDPR compliance efforts are complete, we will update this Privacy Policy to reflect those changes (such as identifying our EU representative, outlining cross-border transfer mechanisms, etc.). We appreciate your understanding and are committed to ambitious standards of privacy globally, not just in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>17.9 </strong><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
<p><em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is not offered directly to children under thirteen for personal sign-up. All users of the platform are adult professionals or authorized staff. However, the system may contain personal information about minors (for example, if a minor is a participant in a counseling program or a juvenile offender in a rehabilitation group). In such cases, that information is entered by the clinic with proper consent from a parent/guardian or as allowed by law.</p>
<p>We operate under the assumption that any minor’s data entered has been collected in compliance with <strong>COPPA</strong> or other relevant laws by the clinic (e.g., parental consent obtained by the clinic if needed). We treat such data with the same important level of confidentiality and security. If a parent or guardian of a minor whose information is in <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>has concerns or wishes to exercise rights on behalf of the child, they should contact the clinic (the data controller). We will assist our client in honoring any valid requests regarding a minor’s data.</p>
<p>If we inadvertently collect personal information directly from a child under thirteen without proper consent (which is unlikely given our closed system), we will delete it as soon as we become aware.</p>
<p><strong>17.10 </strong><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. The “Last Updated” date at the top will indicate when the latest changes were made. If changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice or notify the primary contacts of our client clinics (for example, via email or an in-app notification).</p>
<p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>after any updates signifies your acceptance of the revised policy. If you do not agree to any updated terms, you should stop using the Service and can request your data be returned or deleted as per the above sections.</p>

</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>18. </strong></em><em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Terms of Service (TOS)</strong></p>
<p><em>Last Updated: [March 10, 2025]</em></p>
<p>The following Terms of Service (“TOS”) govern the operational use of the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>Service, including billing, refunds, and cancellation policies. These terms apply to all clients (clinics/organizations) and users of <em>NotesAO</em>. This TOS is a supplementary document to the <strong>End User Agreement (EUA)</strong> above and is intended to provide additional details on how the service is provided day-to-day. By subscribing to <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and using the Service, you agree to these Terms of Service. In case of any conflict between this TOS and the EUA, the EUA (as the primary agreement) will prevail, except where this TOS provides more specific or stricter requirements on operational matters.</p>
<p><strong>18.1 </strong><strong>Service Access and Operational Use</strong></p>
<p><strong>Provision of Service:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will provide your clinic with access to the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>software platform for group-based attendance tracking and report generation. The service includes web-based access for authorized users, data storage and backup, and customer support as described in this TOS. We strive to keep the service available 24/7, aside from planned maintenance windows or unexpected outages (see “Uptime and Maintenance” below).</p>
<p><strong>Account Setup:</strong> During onboarding, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>staff will coordinate with your clinic to create user accounts (2 admins and up to 15-member user accounts by default). We will assist in initial configuration, such as setting up your clinic’s profile in the system, adding your licensed facilitators or staff as users, and providing training materials or sessions so you can effectively use the system. The one-time onboarding fee (see Fees section) covers this setup process. No account will be activated until the onboarding process is complete and initial payment arrangements are confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>User Eligibility and Conduct:</strong> Only individuals affiliated with your organization (employees or contractors such as LPC-certified counselors) should be given access to <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>under your subscription. You are responsible for ensuring that each user is trained in basic use and aware of their responsibilities (as detailed in the EUA’s User Responsibilities section). You should promptly inform <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>if a user leaves your organization or should have their access revoked, so we can deactivate their account for security.</p>
<p><strong>Use for Intended Purpose:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is designed to facilitate group session management, attendance tracking, and related reporting in a clinical or counseling setting. Your use of the Service should align with this purpose. This means:</p>
<p>You will use <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>to record attendance, notes, and relevant participant info for programs like counseling groups, therapy sessions, educational classes mandated by courts, etc.</p>
<p>You will not attempt to use <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>as a general EMR (electronic medical record) or case management system for purposes it’s not designed for, especially if it involves functionalities we don’t support (e.g., scheduling medical appointments, processing payments from clients, etc., which are outside <em>NotesAO</em>’s scope).</p>
<p>You will not rely on <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>as the sole repository of critical data without maintaining any independent copies if such data is mission critical. While we are dependable, we always advise keeping exported copies of crucial reports for your records, especially if required by the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibited Operational Uses:</strong> In addition to the prohibited conduct outlined in the EUA, operationally you agree not to:</p>
<p>Upload any content to <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>that is unrelated to your clinic’s professional activities (for example, personal files, non-client-related media, or using <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>as general cloud storage).</p>
<p>Use any automated scripts or scraping tools to extract data from <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>in a way that could impair service performance or violate others’ privacy.</p>
<p>Share screenshots or printouts from the system that contain sensitive information on public forums or social media.</p>
<p>Attempt to integrate <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>with other software or systems via unauthorized means. (We welcome integration requests, but please coordinate with us for any data import/export beyond the provided features.)</p>
<p><strong>18.2 </strong><strong>Fees and Billing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subscription Plan:</strong> Your subscription to <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>is monthly (unless otherwise agreed in writing for a longer term). The standard plan includes the user accounts and features as described. The pricing for this plan is $120 per month, with a one-time onboarding fee of $500. All prices are quoted in U.S. Dollars (USD).</p>
<p><strong>Onboarding Fee:</strong> The $500 onboarding fee is charged at the start of the service (typically upon signing up or shortly before your training/setup begins). This covers our team’s time in setting up your accounts, customizing any needed settings for your clinic, and providing initial training or data import if applicable. <strong>Refund Policy for Onboarding:</strong> This fee is non-refundable once we have performed the setup work. If you decide to cancel service exceedingly early (for instance, immediately after setting up and before real use), <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>may evaluate refunds case-by-case, but we reserve the right to retain the onboarding fee to cover our costs.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly Subscription Fee:</strong> The $120 monthly fee is typically billed in advance. You will be billed on a regular monthly schedule (for example, if your service starts on the 10th of a month, you might be billed on the 10th of each month thereafter; or all subscriptions might align to the first of the month, per our billing system). We will clarify your billing cycle at the time of onboarding.</p>
<p><strong>Billing Method:</strong> Payment can be made via credit/debit card, ACH bank transfer, or check (for institutions that require it). For automated payments, we will charge your card or account on file each month. For invoices, we will send an invoice to the billing contact you provide, and payment will be due within 30 days of the invoice date (unless otherwise specified). Past due payment may incur interest at 1.5% per month (18% per annum) or the maximum allowed by law, whichever is lower.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong> Our fees do not automatically include state or local sales tax or similar taxes that may apply. If your location or status requires tax on software services or digital products, we may add the appropriate tax to your bill. If you are tax-exempt, please provide a valid exemption certificate so we will not charge tax.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Fees:</strong> We reserve the right to change our subscription fees or introduce new fees (for example, if we add significant new features or new tiers of service). Such changes will be communicated at least 30 days in advance. If you are on a longer-term contract, fee changes would apply upon renewal unless otherwise agreed. Your continued use of the service after the notice period constitutes acceptance of the new fees.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Services:</strong> Any services beyond the standard subscription – such as custom report development, data migration from another system, on-site training, or additional user licenses beyond the 2 admin/15-member allocation – may incur additional charges. These would be discussed and quoted with you in advance. They may be billed either at a one-time rate or added to your subscription, as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>18.3 </strong><strong>Refund Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subscription Fee Refunds:</strong> As a rule, subscription fees (monthly charges) are <strong>non-refundable</strong> once paid. When you pay for a month of access, you have the service available for that entire period. If you decide to stop using <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>or cancel in the middle of a paid period, you will not typically receive a refund for the remaining days of that period; however, you will retain access until the end of the paid term since it’s already paid for. Example: If you paid for the full month of June and decided on June 15 to cancel effective immediately, you would still have access until June 30 but would not get a refund for the unused half of June.</p>
<p><strong>Prorated Charges:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>does not offer prorated refunds or credits for partial months used, except in situations where we may be at fault (such as prolonged downtime—see Service Guarantee below). If, for instance, you upgrade or downgrade plan mid-cycle (if that ever applies, e.g., increasing user count or moving to a different plan), we will manage any prorated adjustments by crediting or charging appropriately on the next invoice rather than refunding mid-cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptional Circumstances:</strong> We want our customers to be satisfied. If you believe there are extenuating circumstances that warrant a refund (for example, you were unable to use the service for a significant portion of time due to a failure on our part, or you accidentally were charged after canceling in time), please contact us at billing@<em>NotesAO</em>.com. We will review requests on a case-by-case basis and may, at our discretion, issue a partial or full refund or a credit toward future service if we find it justified.</p>
<p><strong>Onboarding Fee Refunds:</strong> As stated, the onboarding/setup fee is typically non-refundable after we have completed setup. If you paid the onboarding fee but then circumstances changed <em>before</em> we did any substantial work (e.g., you never actually proceeded with using the system and notify us quickly), we might refund it minus any minimal processing/admin costs. But once your accounts are created and training provided, that fee is earned.</p>
<p><strong>No Refund for Unused Accounts:</strong> If some of the user accounts allocated to you go unused, or if you do not end up utilizing the service fully, we do not provide partial refunds. The subscription covers up to the allowed number of users and features regardless of actual usage. We encourage you to make the most of the system.</p>
<p><strong>18.4 </strong><strong>Cancellation and Termination Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Client-Initiated Cancellation:</strong> You have the right to cancel your <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>subscription at any time. To do so, an authorized representative of your clinic (e.g., an admin user or manager who handles your account) should notify <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>in writing (email is acceptable, sent to your account manager or support@<em>NotesAO</em><em>”</em>.com) of your decision to cancel and the desired effective date. We recommend providing at least 15 days’ notice before your next billing date to ensure you are not charged for the next period.</p>
<p>If you specify an immediate cancellation, we will terminate access as of the notice and not charge further, but note that no refund will be given for any remaining days in the current billing cycle (you can choose to continue using until the period ends since it’s paid).</p>
<p>If you specify cancellation as of the end of your current subscription period, we will schedule the account to deactivate at that time and ensure no further billing beyond that.</p>
<p><em><strong>NotesAO</strong></em><em><strong>”</strong></em><strong>-Initiated Termination:</strong> We reserve the right to terminate the service for your clinic if:</p>
<p>You materially breach the EUA or these TOS (for example, by misusing the system or violating confidentiality obligations) and do not cure the breach after notice.</p>
<p>You fail to pay subscription fees within the prescribed period and remain in arrears after the remainder and a grace period (typically we would send late notices, give an extra 15 days, etc.).</p>
<p>We cease offering the <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>service entirely. (In such a case, we would provide ample notice, e.g., 60 days, and assist with data export. We are committed to supporting you, so this is a last resort scenario like company closure or major business pivot.)</p>
<p>In the case of termination due to breach or non-payment, we may disable access immediately or on short notice depending on the situation’s severity. We will, however, provide you with an opportunity to retrieve your data whenever possible (unless the termination is due to legal prohibition or something that prevents even that).</p>
<p><strong>Effect of Cancellation/Termination:</strong> After cancellation or termination:</p>
<p>Your users will no longer be able to log into <em>NotesAO</em> (once the effective date passes).</p>
<p>We recommend that prior to termination, you utilize our reporting and export features to download any records you might need in the future (attendance reports, client lists, etc.). If you need assistance in exporting data, let us know during the notice period.</p>
<p>We will retain your data for a brief period as described in the Privacy Policy (usually 30-60 days) in case you change your mind or need something recovered, but after that period, data will be deleted from active systems.</p>
<p>Any fees owed up to the date of termination remain payable. If termination is due to non-payment, we still reserve the right to collect on the invoices owed.</p>
<p>The onboarding fee is not refunded upon cancellation, as it was for initial setup work already done.</p>
<p><strong>Reactivation:</strong> If you cancel and later decide to return, you will need to pay a new onboarding fee (especially if the data is deleted and we must set you up from scratch again). If data was preserved by special arrangement, we could discuss reactivation without full onboarding. Reactivation is subject to current pricing and terms at the time of re-signup.</p>
<p><strong>18.5 </strong><strong>Uptime and Maintenance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service Availability:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>aims to provide reliable service, but we do not guarantee a specific uptime percentage. However, we design our system for high availability and monitor it 24/7. In general, you can expect the service to be available most of the time. If there are any widespread issues or outages, our technical team will work to resolve them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance Windows:</strong> From time to time, we will perform scheduled maintenance or upgrades to the system. When possible, these will be done during off-peak hours (for example, late nights or weekends) to minimize impact. We will provide advance notice via email to admin users or via an in-app banner if a significant downtime is expected (e.g., “The system will be undergoing maintenance on Sunday from 1 AM to 3 AM Central Time”). During maintenance windows, access may be limited, or the system may be slower. We appreciate your understanding as we improve our services.</p>
<p><strong>Updates and Features:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>will periodically receive updates, including security patches, new features, and improvements. These updates are typically pushed automatically and should not disrupt usage (aside from requiring a refresh or re-login after an update). We may notify you of major new features or changes in the interface. All updates are provided as part of your subscription – there are no separate licensing fees for new versions if you are subscribed.</p>
<p><strong>Support:</strong> Included in your subscription, <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>offers support to help with any issues:</p>
<p><strong>Email Support:</strong> You can email our support team at support@<em>NotesAO</em>.com. We aim to respond to support emails within one business day, often sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Phone Support:</strong> During normal business hours (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM Central Time, Monday-Friday), you can call our support line (817-501-5102) for urgent issues or questions. If we are unavailable immediately, leave a message and we will return your call.</p>
<p><strong>Support Scope:</strong> We can assist with problems like login difficulties, bugs or errors in the system, questions on how to do something in the platform, or requests for minor data corrections (like if something got stuck or needs admin fix). We will also take note of your feedback or feature requests.</p>
<p><strong>Training:</strong> Initially, we provide training as part of onboarding. Later, if you have fresh staff who need training, we can provide materials (like user guides, FAQs) and limited remote training sessions if needed. Extensive re-training might incur a fee, but we will discuss that if applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Service Level Issues:</strong> If our service experiences a significant outage (for example, the system is completely down for an extended period outside scheduled maintenance), we may at our discretion offer a service credit on your next billing to compensate for the inconvenience, especially if it impacted your operations. This is not a promise of compensation, but a gesture of goodwill since we disclaim formal uptime guarantees. For instance, if the system was unusable for a full day due to our server issues, we might credit a day’s worth of service value on your next invoice.</p>
<p><strong>18.6 </strong><strong>Data Ownership and Access to Data</strong></p>
<p><strong>Client Data Ownership:</strong> You retain all rights to the data you or your users input into <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>about your clients and operations. <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>does not own your underlying client information or the content of your reports. Our role is to process and host that data on your behalf. As such, you are responsible for the content and accuracy of the data, and you have control over it.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Your Data:</strong> Throughout your subscription, you can access, download, and use your data via the platform’s functionality. If you need assistance in extracting data in bulk (for example, to provide records to an oversight body, or to migrate to another system), let us know and we’ll help, possibly using our admin tools to get you what you need in a common format.</p>
<p><strong>Data Portability:</strong> If you decide to leave <em>NotesAO</em>, we are committed to not trapping your data. During the termination/cancellation process (or even before, if you are evaluating whether to leave), you can request a full export of your data. We will provide it in a structured format (such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or PDF report bundles) as appropriate. Some data (like relational links between records) will be preserved as best as we can. We will do this at no additional cost if it is a straightforward export. If you have an extraordinarily complex or large data set that requires special handling, we will discuss any costs in advance, but that is rare.</p>
<p><strong>Data After Termination:</strong> As described in the Privacy Policy, after your subscription ends and after a grace period, we will delete personal data from our active systems. If you realize you forgot to get something after termination, there is a short window where we might retrieve backups, but we cannot guarantee after a certain point. Therefore, ensure you have everything you need before the account is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality of Data:</strong> We treat your data as confidential (see Privacy Policy and relevant EUA sections). Even though we can access it for support, we do not view or use your client data unless necessary for a support issue or required by law. We also expect you to maintain confidentiality of any data you extract – once data is in your hands (exported or printed reports), it is up to you to protect it according to HIPAA and privacy principles.</p>
<p><strong>18.7 </strong><strong>Modifications to Service and Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>Changes to Service:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>reserves the right to modify or discontinue any feature or aspect of the Service at any time. We will try not to remove core features without good reason or without providing an alternative solution. If we do plan to remove or significantly change a feature, we will notify you in advance (for example, if a certain report format is being replaced by a new format). Most changes are enhancements, but occasionally we might remove support for something that is outdated or not widely used.</p>
<p><strong>Terms Updates:</strong> These Terms of Service may be updated occasionally, as might the EUA or Privacy Policy. We will notify account administrators of major changes to terms (usually via email or an announcement on the platform). Minor tweaks that do not materially affect your rights may be posted with the updated date. It is important that you or someone in your organization review such updates. Continued use of the Service after an update constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
<p><strong>Contractual Commitments:</strong> If you have a separate written contract or order form with <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>that stipulates certain terms (for example, a one-year commitment at a fixed price, or a custom arrangement), those terms will supersede any conflicting provisions in this generic TOS. This TOS is intended to cover our standard service. Any negotiated changes or additions in your specific agreement with us will be honored as per that agreement.</p>
<p><strong>18.8 </strong><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><strong> Provisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Independent Contractor:</strong> <em>NotesAO</em> (Free for Life Group PC) is an independent contractor to your organization. Nothing in this TOS or EUA creates a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, or fiduciary relationship between the parties. You do not have any authority to bind <em>NotesAO</em>, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> These terms are between you and <em>NotesAO</em>. No other person or entity shall be deemed a beneficiary of this agreement. For example, your clients (the program participants) are not party to this contract with us; their relationship is primarily with you, and our duties to protect their data come via our agreement with you and by operation of law, not because they individually agreed to these terms.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnity by Clinic:</strong> (This reiterates part of EUA) You agree to indemnify and hold <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>harmless from any claims or liabilities arising out of your misuse of the Service or violation of laws. If a third party (like a client or government agency) sues or fines <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>due to something your organization did or failed to do (for instance, misuse of data, or using the system in an unlawful way), you will cover our costs as described in the EUA’s indemnification clause.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> The limitations of liability outlined in the EUA apply to any claims under these Terms of Service as well. <em>NotesAO</em>’s liability for issues relating to billing, refunds, or service performance is limited as described in the EUA (“Limitation of Liability” section). In short, we do not assume liability for losses related to your use of the service beyond what is allowed by law, and any potential liability is capped at the amounts you paid.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law and Disputes:</strong> This TOS is governed by Texas law, just like the EUA. Any disputes will follow the same dispute resolution process specified in the EUA (including arbitration if invoked). For ease of reference: we encourage resolving any issues informally or through mediation. If formal dispute resolution is needed, Texas courts (or arbitration in Texas) will have authority.</p>
<p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these TOS is found invalid or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect. For example, if a particular state’s law does not allow a certain fee arrangement or disclaimer, that part would be modified to comply with law while preserving intent, and the rest of the terms stay enforceable.</p>
<p><strong>Contact for Billing/Legal Issues:</strong> If you have any questions about billing, terms, or need to send any notices under these TOS or the EUA, you can contact:</p>
<p><strong>Billing Department:</strong> billing@<em>NotesAO</em>.com</p>
<p><strong>Legal/Notices:</strong> Free for Life Group PC d/b/a <em>NotesAO</em>, Attn: Legal Department, 1100 East Lancaster Ave, Fort Worth, TX 76102.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep us updated with your proper contact information for notices (such as any change in your organization’s email, address, or billing contact).</p>
<p>By using <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>and paying subscription fees, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to this Terms of Service, and you have the authority to bind your organization to these terms. We value our partnership with you and are committed to providing a service that meets your needs while protecting the privacy and security of all data involved. Here is to a successful and compliant use of <em>NotesAO</em><em> </em>for your clinic’s benefit!</p>
